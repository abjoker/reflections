How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff between two versions of a file helps me 
	to see the typo or other syntax errors which I might, 
	have made in an efficient and easy manner. 
	
	This hopefully might saves me from hours and hours of work
	where I have to see through all the lines of code, to see the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to the entire history of a file increases my efficiency 
	because I can make a detailed interpretation of the changes that I 
	have made which enables me to find out the reasons for making those
    changes and also restoring the previous editions of the work incase I am
    not satisfied with the present changes. 	

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: It intoduces flexibility in choosing to save our files
	      We do not end up saving too many versions which practically
		  have no significant change
	Cons: We might forget to save our files which could be fatal
	      as incase a bug occurs we may not be able to detect the
		  changes which resulted in a bug in our code and also
		  we have too fewer versions having enormously different
		  changes, which reduces the efficiency of determining the 
		  code changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Well, git is used mainly for a large coding project involving multiple language
   and each file is mainly written in only one language. Thus while performing a 
   single commit anyone might have changed multiple files, thus allowing to save multiple
   files in a single commit may become necessary
   
   Google docs, on the other hand generally involves a text document, which are generally not 
   correlated and even if their exists any correlation between these multiple files
   they may not be changed in short durations, also any user in google doc would generally
   work on any one text document at a time,hence Google Docs treats each file separately

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log can be used to view the history of commits made and to identify when it 
	was changed as well ny whom was it changed
	
	Git diff is uesd to find the difference between any two commits to identify the lines which
	were deleted or added.
	
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control enables me to view the previous versions of the work
	and also determines the lines which were deleted or added, apart from that
	I can also preview the previous versions of the work so as to determine the 
	commit where the bug was not introduced, all of this is possible using git
	checkout. Thus version control makes me more confident of solving the bug
	incase it was intoduced accidently.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git to create a repository having my c++ mini project
	and I require so as to help me setting up the file-handling properly
	for creating file for the items-list, so that I do not need to manually
	enter the items again and again.
