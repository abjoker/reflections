When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository when I want to share my code to others  or to 
	collaborate my code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes from the github repository onto my local repository on a frequent basis 
	is essential as it enables me to mnanually find out the changes made so that I can track
	it down incase a bug was introduced due to it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are use to make an exact copy of a repository of another github user
	so taht we can make changes on that repository on our forked version rather than 
	changing the original version of the repository
	
	Clones are used for obtaining the repository from the github server right onto our
	own local computer. It is a another way of downloading the project file directly 
	using the git bash command line.
	
	Branches are used on our computer for obtaing a different version of a project 
	or to make some experimental changes that should not be shown in the 
	main code.
	
	Forks should be chosen for copying a repository from another github user.
	Clones should be chosen for downloading the repository onto our own local computer.
	Branches should be chosen generally for obtaing a differnt version of a eork or
	for performing some experimental changes.
	

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
